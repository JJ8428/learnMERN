# learn_(Node.js, MERN, Full Stack etc.)

This is my attempt to fully learn Node.js from a multitude of resources. These are notes that I have typed myself having spent atleast 15+ hours going over the necessary documentation and tutorials.

Almost every *.js file can be run with:
```javascript
node <file_name>.js
```

Folder <b>1-node</b> consists of the basic Javascript and Node.js, such as:
* module.exports = ...
* async patterns
* basic http server
* npm install/remove
* etc.

Folder <b>2-express</b> explores Node.js further with Express.js, some are: 
* basic express app
* middleware
* light exploration of MVC architecture
* req and res objects
* etc.

Folder <b>A-mongo</b> explores how to...
* connect to a noSQL database: Mongo
  * I recommend using Mongo ATLAS; it is very friendly for new developers/students.
* set up schemas for objects

Folder <b>B-JWT</b> essentially does all of what the previous folder does, but in addition, it also does:
* a more through demonstration of MVC, middleware
* decent authenciation
* an introduction to the EJS template engine
* protected routes/views

To the content in Folders A and B, use the following to launch the code. Make sure to read the console for any useful info.
```javascript
node app.js
```

More to come, such as React.js so the 'R' in MERN can actually be said.
