nodemon is a very useful package for developers
This will let you work on your server without restarting it for every change

package.json saves a record dependencies
node_modules saves all dependencies

To create it:
npm init -y

When doing source control, make sure to create a .gitignore file with '/node_modules'

Within package.json, if you go to "scripts" and make it...
"scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js", // Change this to the ACTUAL app.js
    "dev": "nodemon app.js",
}
... you can now start the project very quickly with just npm start/dev
